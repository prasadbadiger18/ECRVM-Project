            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Day to Day the amount of waste littered on roads is increasing. With the ban on plastics, yet the major littering occurs at bus stands and Railway stations includes the water bottles, aluminum cans and plastic bags which are hazardous to the environment. Additionally no one bothers about the social responsibility to dump the waste in the dustbins thereby causing a serious issue. This project deals with environment friendly reverse vending machine. The smart machine accepts the plastic waste bottles, aluminum waste cans and plastic bags and uses Imageprocessing based system consist of camera to capture and analyze the waste to check if the material inserted in the machine is either of the three and it provides credit points in return to the person recycling the waste.</p>
            <p>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp A Reverse vending Machine is a system which accepts different wastes for recycling and in return dispenses money or credit points to the person who recycles the waste. The amount of credit points calculated based on the type of waste inserted in the machine. This invention relates in general to waste management and recycling the plastic and other waste in the environment. The collected waste is further segregated in the machine and collected in different waste bins which can be collected for recycling. If the bins are full sms notification will be sent to the concerned authorities. The littering of plastic wastes in the environment and less willingness to recycle the plastic presents a continuing problem to environment and to all the living beings which is expected to be handled using the proposed project.</p>

            <h2>How It Works</h2>
            <p>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The operational workflow of the RVM is meticulously designed to automate and optimize the waste recycling process.This section provides a comprehensive overview of the sequential steps involved in using the RVM, from user interaction to waste segregation and recycling. To begin using our reverse vending machine as a new user, the first step is to obtain an RFID card from the administrator's office.</p>
            <p>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp When approaching the machine for the initial setup, the user should press the "Recycle" button to begin the registration process. Upon scanning their RFID card, which is unrecognized in the system for new users, the machine will display a website link prompting the user to register. By following this link, the user can access our registration portal and create a new account by providing necessary details. During registration, the user will be asked to input the RFID number associated with their card. To retrieve this number, they can press the "Know Your RFID" button on the machine, which will display the required information. Once the registration is complete and the user has successfully logged in to the website using their newly created credentials, they can verify their credit points tied to the RFID card. This comprehensive process ensures that new users are seamlessly integrated into our system, allowing them to access their account details and credit points before engaging in recycling activities with our reverse vending machine.</p>
